I graduated from Tufts University in May of 2016 with a degree in Civil Engineering and a minor in Engineering Management. I'm currently making my rotations through Liberty Mutual's Technical Developement Program. In my first 6-month rotation, I worked as a User Experience (UX) researcher for the Digital Experience Group in Boston, Massachusetts. We focused on using lean method and Design thinking approaches to understand the user mindset. In my current rotation in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, I'm a Data and Services lead on a five person Agile team. We're focused on creating a new UI and migrating 1 billion documents into an online document repostitory. </h5></center></p>

      <p><center><h3>My Personal Life</h3><h5> Aside from my time at work, I spend a decent amount of my time indulging in my hobbies. I spend a lot of time dancing/ practicing. I bboy (breakdance) regularly on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at MIT Building 36 Floor 3. I'm interested in men's fashion, particularly streetwear, but have recently been moving towards a menswear direction. I receive a lot of inspiration from sub-Reddits that focused on clothes, interior design, and furniture. Recently, I obtained my driver's license, which helped spark an interest in car modifcations and vehicle construction. Instead of television, I watch anime, which is Japanese animations. My current favorites are One Piece, Tokyo Ghoul, Shokugeki, and Attack on Titan. My list of hobbies is decently long, but these are all things I do throughout the week, actively or passively, but when I do have more down time, I try photography. Photography gives me opportunities to explore Boston and get to know my city a little more. Although I have not recently had the time to wander, I am getting back into it. </h5></p>
